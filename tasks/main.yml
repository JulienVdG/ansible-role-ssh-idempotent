#   https://dmsimard.com/2016/03/15/changing-the-ssh-port-with-ansible/
#   Author: Julien Viard de Galbert <julien@vdg.name>
#   Major Changes:
#     - moved the discovery part to discover_port.yml and detect_port.yml
#     - reworked the discovery to handle a cached last known working port
#     - added similar feature to detect and create the user
#     - moved the selinux part to hooks/selinux.yml

# This task list handles detecting the current SSH port and User
# reconfiguring them if needed

# ansible_port can change throughout this role, keep a copy of it
