#   Author: Julien Viard de Galbert <julien@vdg.name>
#   Major Changes:
#     - moved the discovery part to discover_port.yml and detect_port.yml
#     - reworked the discovery to handle a cached last known working port

# This task list handles connecting to the right SSH port

- name: Check last used SSH port
  include_tasks: detect_port.yml ssh_detect_port="{{ ssh_last_port }}" ssh_detect_name="cached_last"
  when: ssh_last_port is defined

- name: Check inventory-provided SSH port
  include_tasks: detect_port.yml ssh_detect_port="{{ ssh_configured_port }}" ssh_detect_name="configured"
  when:
    - ssh_cached_last_port_set is undefined

- name: Check default SSH port
  include_tasks: detect_port.yml ssh_detect_port="{{ ssh_bootstrap_port }}" ssh_detect_name="default"
  when:
    - ssh_cached_last_port_set is undefined
    - ssh_configured_port_set is undefined

- name: Fail if SSH port was not auto-detected (unknown)
  fail:
    msg: "The SSH port is neither {{ (ssh_bootstrap_port, ssh_last_port | default(false)) | select | join(', ') }} or {{ ssh_configured_port }}."
  when:
    - ssh_cached_last_port_set is undefined
    - ssh_configured_port_set is undefined
    - ssh_default_port_set is undefined
