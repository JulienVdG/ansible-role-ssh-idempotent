#   Author: Julien Viard de Galbert <julien@vdg.name>
#   Major Changes:
#     - moved the discovery part to discover_port.yml and detect_port.yml
#     - reworked the discovery to handle a cached last known working port

# This task list handles detecting if a provided SSH port is potentially correct
